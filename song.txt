I've been to places where the sun goes down
Each day and never rises
I've been to places in a dark room
Where we played with our disguises

Heaven, I'm in heaven
I'm in seventh heaven now
Seventh heaven

It was a dream, I heard a voice
I put it down to wishful thinking
It was a dream, a silent scream
Out of the blue, a new beginning

Heaven, I'm in heaven
I'm in seventh heaven now
Seventh heaven
